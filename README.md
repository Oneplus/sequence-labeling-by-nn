#Sequence Labeling by Neural Network

The repository is for sequence labeling through neural negwork (deep learning) methods .

it is now based on [CNN library](https://github.com/clab/cnn)

steps :

1. postagging based on example `tag-bilstm.cc` of CNN [doing]

2. chinese segmentation(using sequence labeling method) , ner , srl

3. more various structures based on CNN

4. (almost)from scratch ?
